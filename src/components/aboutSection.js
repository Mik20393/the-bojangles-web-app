            <p>from Glasgow, formed in 2023. We love experimenting with</p>
            <p>jazzy, funky feel-good rhythyms, our lyrics range from</p>
            <p>playful to introspective.</p>
            <p>The band came together through a serious of fortuitous</p>
            <p>encounters at a local pub, where musicians from different</p>
            <p>backgrounds and musical influences connected, all sharing</p>
            <p>a passion and desire to be a part of something exciting and</p>
            <p>unique. Our music features Portuguese lyrics, Latin</p>
            <p>melodies, boom-bap beats, funky guitar riffs, brass</p>
